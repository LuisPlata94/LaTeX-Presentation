# LaTeX-Presentation
Template with a presentation made in LaTeX with multiple examples and intended to be used for scientific presentations

Originally, part of the #100DaysOfCode, but I pretend to just add new examples as I use them for my presentations: https://github.com/LuisPlata94/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md
