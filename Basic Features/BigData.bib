abstract = {The globalization of the world's economies is a major challenge to local industry and it is pushing the manufacturing sector to its next transformation - predictive manufacturing. In order to become more competitive, manufacturers need to embrace emerging technologies, such as advanced analytics and cyber-physical system-based approaches, to improve their efficiency and productivity. With an aggressive push towards "Internet of Things", data has become more accessible and ubiquitous, contributing to the big data environment. This phenomenon necessitates the right approach and tools to convert data into useful, actionable information. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME).},

@article{Sindhu2017,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}With advent of Big Data Analytics, the healthcare system is increasingly adopting the analytical services that is ultimately found to generate massive load of highly unstructured data. We reviewed the existing system to find that there are lesser number of solutions towards addressing the problems of data variety, data uncertainty, and data speed. It is important that an error-free data should arrive in analytics. Existing system offers single-hand solution towards single platform. Therefore, we introduced an integrated framework that has the capability to address all these three problems in one execution time. Considering the synthetic big data of healthcare, we carried out the investigation to find that our proposed system using deep learning architecture offers better optimization of computational resources. The study outcome is found to offer comparatively better response time and higher accuracy rate as compared to existing optimization technqiues that is found and practiced widely in literature.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Today, in an Industry 4.0 factory, machines are connected as a collaborative community. Such evolution requires the utilization of advance-prediction tools, so that data can be systematically processed into information to explain uncertainties, and thereby make more "informed" decisions. Cyber-Physical System-based manufacturing and service innovations are two inevitable trends and challenges for manufacturing industries. This paper addresses the trends of manufacturing service transformation in big data environment, as well as the readiness of smart predictive informatics tools to manage big data, thereby achieving transparency and productivity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {One of the most significant directions in the development of computer science and information and communication technologies is represented by Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) which are systems of collaborating computational entities which are in intensive connection with the surrounding physical world and its on-going processes, providing and using, at the same time, data-Accessing and data-processing services available on the internet. Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs), relying on the newest and foreseeable further developments of computer science, information and communication technologies on the one hand, and of manufacturing science and technology, on the other, may lead to the 4th Industrial Revolution, frequently noted as Industry 4.0. The key-note will underline that there are significant roots generally -And particularly in the CIRP community -which point towards CPPSs. Expectations and the related new R{\&}D challenges will be outlined. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe a demonstration as it was presented to a wide audience at the Hannover Messe Industrie 2010. The demonstration shows a future production scenario spanning several linked stages ranging from individual ordering over assembly, filling, and shipping to individual support and comprises in total 5 demonstrators from 5 partners. Visitors could order and configure their own product and how to ship. Products which were produced in this scenario were equipped with a so-called digital product memory. Via this digital product memory data is collected along the product life cycle from individual ordering, assembling, filling to shipping. At home the user could browse the digital product memory and benefit from individual services which build up on the digital product memory.},
